VitePress is [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org)' spiritual successor, built on top of [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

Currently, it is in the `beta` stage. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use. There still might be issues, however, we do not plan to introduce any breaking changes from here on until the stable release.
